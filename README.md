# üê±üê∂ Cat & Dog Image Classifier
A deep learning project that uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with Keras to classify images of cats and dogs. This project demonstrates image preprocessing, model building, data augmentation, and performance evaluation techniques.
# üìö Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a reliable model capable of distinguishing between images of cats and dogs. Using Keras and TensorFlow, we trained a CNN on a balanced dataset of cat and dog images and evaluated its performance to ensure high accuracy and generalization.
# üß† Features
**Image Dataset:** Used a balanced dataset of 1000 images for each class (cats and dogs).                                          
**Data Augmentation:** Applied techniques like random flipping, rotation, zooming, and brightness adjustment to enhance generalization.                            
**Deep Learning Architecture:** A CNN designed with multiple convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.                                
**Performance Metrics:** Evaluated the model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.                                         
**Deployment Ready:** The model can be deployed to classify new images of cats and dogs.
